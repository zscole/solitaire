# Solitaire Encryption Algorithm

The following code was taken from Neal Stephenson's novel, [Cryptonomicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptonomicon), and was originally designed by [Bruce Schenier](https://www.schneier.com/). Since I couldn't find reliable source code for it, I decided to transcribe it and make a few changes of my own, but found [Ian Goldberg's](https://www.cypherpunks.ca/~iang/) verbose transcription in an old [email archive](https://mail.pm.org/pipermail/hudson-valley-pm/2000-September/000048.html). I've seen several reiterations of this same algorithm in various programming languages and I'd like to take a crack at implementing it in Go.
